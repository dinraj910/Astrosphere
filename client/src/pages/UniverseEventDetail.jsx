    description: `The Big Bang marks the birth of our universe, about 13.8 billion years ago. In a fraction of a second, all matter, energy, space, and time erupted from a singularity‚Äîan infinitely hot, dense point. This event set the stage for everything: the laws of physics, the formation of atoms, and the cosmic expansion that continues today. 
    After the initial explosion, the universe cooled rapidly, allowing subatomic particles to form. Within minutes, protons and neutrons fused into the first atomic nuclei. For hundreds of thousands of years, the universe was a hot, opaque soup, until it cooled enough for atoms to form and light to travel freely. This ancient light, the cosmic microwave background, is still detectable today. The Big Bang is not just an explosion, but the beginning of space and time itself.`,
    facts: [
      "The universe began as a singularity.",
      "All space, time, matter, and energy originated here.",
      "Cosmic microwave background is the Big Bang's afterglow.",

      "Fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, etc.) emerged.",

Gravity pulled these gases together, forming the first stars‚Äîmassive, hot, and short-lived.

These stars exploded as supernovae, scattering elements and triggering the formation of new stars and galaxies.`,
